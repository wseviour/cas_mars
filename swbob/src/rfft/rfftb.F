C     SUBROUTINE RFFTB(N,R,WSAVE)
C
C     SUBROUTINE RFFTB COMPUTES THE REAL PERODIC SEQUENCE FROM ITS
C     FOURIER COEFFICIENTS (FOURIER SYNTHESIS). THE TRANSFORM IS DEFINED
C     BELOW AT OUTPUT PARAMETER R.
C
C     INPUT PARAMETERS
C
C     N       THE LENGTH OF THE ARRAY R TO BE TRANSFORMED.  THE METHOD
C             IS MOST EFFICIENT WHEN N IS A PRODUCT OF SMALL PRIMES.
C             N MAY CHANGE SO LONG AS DIFFERENT WORK ARRAYS ARE PROVIDED
C
C     R       A REAL ARRAY OF LENGTH N WHICH CONTAINS THE SEQUENCE
C             TO BE TRANSFORMED
C
C     WSAVE   A WORK ARRAY WHICH MUST BE DIMENSIONED AT LEAST 2*N+15.
C             IN THE PROGRAM THAT CALLS RFFTB. THE WSAVE ARRAY MUST BE
C             INITIALIZED BY CALLING SUBROUTINE RFFTI(N,WSAVE) AND A
C             DIFFERENT WSAVE ARRAY MUST BE USED FOR EACH DIFFERENT
C             VALUE OF N. THIS INITIALIZATION DOES NOT HAVE TO BE
C             REPEATED SO LONG AS N REMAINS UNCHANGED THUS SUBSEQUENT
C             TRANSFORMS CAN BE OBTAINED FASTER THAN THE FIRST.
C             THE SAME WSAVE ARRAY CAN BE USED BY RFFTF AND RFFTB.

C
C      *****  NOTE
C                  THIS TRANSFORM IS UNNORMALIZED SINCE A CALL OF RFFTF
C                  FOLLOWED BY A CALL OF RFFTB WILL MULTIPLY THE INPUT
C                  SEQUENCE BY N.

C     WSAVE   CONTAINS RESULTS WHICH MUST NOT BE DESTROYED BETWEEN
C             CALLS OF RFFTB OR RFFTF.
