        TIMING ROUTINES FOR COMPUTATIONAL SUPPORT BENCHMARKS

subroutine timer_clear (timer_id)
	timer_clear sets to 0 all stats for timer_id.
	error if is not 0 < timer_id and <= MAX_TIMER

subroutine timer_start (timer_id)
        starts timer timer_id, increments number of starts.
	error if is not 0 < timer_id and <= MAX_TIMER
        error if timer was never cleared (initialized)

subroutine timer_stop (timer_id)
        accumulates time in seconds since the last start.
	error if is not 0 < timer_id and <= MAX_TIMER
        error if timer was never cleared (initialized)

real*8 function timer_time (timer_id)
	returns the total time in seconds  that have been
	accumulated on timer timer_id.
	error if is not 0 < timer_id and <= MAX_TIMER
        error if timer was never cleared (initialized)

integer function timer_calls (timer_id)
	returns the number of starts on timer timer_id.
	error if is not 0 < timer_id and <= MAX_TIMER
        error if timer was never cleared (initialized)

real*8 function timer_clock ()
       vendor supplied function which returns a real*8 value
       representing the current clock reading in seconds.
       Currently supported vendor machine types in timer_clock.c:
       SUN, IBM, T3D, YMP
